## üöÄ Overview

The Mobile Radio FoxBot is a battery-powered autonomous system designed for high-frequency signal tracking and mobile communication in a field environment. Amateur Radio Directional Finding (ADRF) is a sport in which an individual tries to locate a hidden transmitting device. Our goal was to develop a rover that will complete this task. Additionally, our robot will increase the potential of ARDF training and aid in the engineering of directional antennas. 


## üõ†Ô∏è Key Contributions

- **Designed a custom 4-layer power PCB** with 3 isolated power rails (3.3V, 5V, 7.4V) and 3 independent battery monitoring circuits.
- **Implemented I2C-based battery monitoring** for accurate state-of-charge reporting, reducing data error rates by 30%.
- **Used FreeRTOS with C++** to acquire and process real-time sensor data, improving system response and telemetry reliability.
- **Collaborated with a cross-functional team** to develop an autopilot system using GPS and walkie-talkie integration for remote operation.
- Conducted hardware testing and validation using oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, and custom debug firmware.
