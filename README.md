# brady-lagrone-portfolio

I'm an **Electrical Engineering student at Texas A&M University**, graduating in **December 2025** with a minor in Mathematics. My focus areas include **embedded systems**, **power systems**, and **data analysis**, and I enjoy solving real-world engineering problems through hands-on design, simulation, and programming.

This GitHub repository serves as my engineering **project portfolio**â€”a curated collection of work I've completed during my academic career, internships, and self-driven learning.
